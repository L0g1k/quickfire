{"name":"Quickfire","tagline":"An open source code editor for Google Chrome, written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.","body":"### Welcome to Quickfire for Google Chrome.\r\nQuickfire is a code editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs as a Chrome [packaged app](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html). It's based on Adobe's [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets), and includes support for 'Live Development' with the help of a [Chrome extension](https://github.com/L0g1k/brackets-devtools). Quickfire also has a built-in web server and can run offline. \r\n\r\n### Local directory support \r\nCoding in the cloud is awesome, but sometimes you want to work locally. Quickfire uses Chrome's fileSystem API to load your existing file system directories as projects, just as you'd expect with a normal code editor. That means you can quickly install Quickfire through the Chrome store, and try it out on a project that's already on your computer.   \r\n\r\n### Built-in web server\r\nYou might already have a web server on your machine. If you don't, Quickfire comes bundled with one that will automatically work out of the box with the projects you load. It will serve your files using an http://localhost url. It starts on port 8081 by default, so if you use that port then please change it in the settings.\r\n\r\n### Live Development\r\nTo use Brackets' [Live Development](http://blog.brackets.io/2013/02/08/live-development-with-brackets-experimental/), you need an additional extension. That's because Chrome's packaged apps aren't given all the same permissions as extensions; in particular they don't have access to Chrome's debugger API. The extension is a quick install, and will only run on localhost. If you try to start Live Development without it, you'll be prompted to install the extension so Quickfire can talk to the Chrome debugger. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Quickfire? Flick me an email at jmitcheson@gmail.com, or log an issue using Github,  and I'll help you out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
